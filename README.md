PPMax72xxPanel
==============

An Arduino library for controlling a canvas of sets of 8x8 LEDs driven by MAX7219 or MAX7221 controllers. [Kits][hardware] sold for below 10 USD.

This is a plugin for Adafruit's core graphics library GFX, providing basic graphics primitives (points, lines, circles, characters, etc.). So besides this library, you need to download and install [Adafruit_GFX][gfx-download], *dated Jul 5th, 2013 or more recent*.
